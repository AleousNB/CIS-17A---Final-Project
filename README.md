# CIS-17A---Final-Project

The purpose of the final project is to demonstrate a solid understanding of the principles taught during the course of the semester.  Furthermore, it is purposefully open-ended to encourage the creative process and foster personal investment in the end-product.

## Rules
+ While code-copying/reuse is allowed it absolutely MUST be credited.  Code copying/reuse will have no negative impact upon your score unless it is absolutely clear that the author does not understand the code in question.  Code that is copied without citation (note, a simple comment indicating the source is fine) will be marked down.
+ Teaming up for the assignment is absolutely allowed, and is, in fact, encouraged.  The only requirement here is that each team member contribute their own code via git.  Teams should contain no more than 3-4 members.

## Requirements
- [ ] Classes – This is the primary requirement for the project.  Demonstrate an understanding of code-reuse and encapsulation by using classes.  More than 2.
  - [ ] Inheritance – At least one example
  -	[ ] Access Modifiers – Demonstrate an understanding of private/public/protected
+ [ ] Polymorphism – At least one example
+ [ ] Recursion – At least one example
+ [ ] Generic Collections – At least 2 examples
+ [ ] Dynamic memory allocation – Use liberally
+ [ ] Exception Handling – Use liberally
+ [ ] Operator Overloading – At least 1 example
+ [ ] Errors – At this point there should be a good understanding of how to use the debugger.  Points will be deducted for bugs.
